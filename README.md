## Story
> You really like coins. Whenever you get any money, you immediately
convert it into 1 cent coins and put them in your money vault.
Alas, a bunch of evil vacuum cleaners are trying to steal your income,
and losing too much money means you can't continue to provide for
yourself (i.e. you lose the game).
